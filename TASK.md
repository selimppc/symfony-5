## Test task for Symfony developer

According to the tax laws and accounting standards when trading in tangible products their accounting
must be done using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) principle. I.e. the product that was purchased from the
supplier at the earliest date, must be sold before other items that were purchased later.
This becomes important when calculating profits and margins in particular – i.e. how much the sale
price was higher than the purchase price – especially when the inflow and outflow of products to/from
the warehouse is continuous.

Example scenario: Lets say we purchased 10 garden gnomes for €17 each and then sold 6 of them for
€21 each. Then we purchased 10 more gnomes for €20 each and sold 8 more for €23 each.
It means that the first 6 gnomes were bought for €17 and sold for 21€ thus making a profit of €4 per
item or €24 in total. Then, in order to sell the next 8 gnomes we first have to sell 4 gnomes from the first
purchase batch (purchased for €17 each) and then 4 gnomes from the second batch (at €20 each). So
the profit from this second sale is (€23-€17)x4 + (€23-€20)x4 = €6x4 + €3x4 = €36. And thus the total
margin of all sales was €24 + €36 = €60.
The remaining 6 gnomes are not included in the calculations as they have not been sold yet.

### Your task

Your task is to create a margin calculator which would calculate the accumulated total profit from the
given sequences of purchases and sales.
The calculator has to accept the input purchases and sales one at a time. For that purpose there should
be to actions – buy and sell, each consisting of two inputs – quantity (integer) and price (a plain number
without the currency designation). The sequence of buy and sell actions can be of any length and
given in any order.
Finally, there has to be an action to the get the total profit. It does not take any input and returns a
single number – the total profit generated by the sequence of buy/sell actions entered up to this
moment.
In order to demonstrate your skills in specific areas we ask you to provide the solution using the latest
version of Symfony framework using Doctrine ORM and MySQL database. The user interface should
be a minimal web page that uses Boostrap for basic styling and the html content should be rendered
using Twig template engine. Dependencies should be managed using Composer.

### What makes up a solution

The task deliverable should be a single ZIP file, containing all the necessary data for launching your
solution. This information must include brief instructions what steps need to be performed in order to
start your application, what system requirements need to be fulfilled, and and any other critical
information.
The solution should be able to run on a 2 CPU core and 4 GB RAM Linux server environment.

### The Goal

The purpose of this task is not only to get the correct answer but also to demonstrate your skills,
thought process, code quality and style, your knowledge of data structures, algorithms and available
libraries. So we strongly recomment to carefully and critically review your solution before submitting.
Please only submit the solution when you can honestly say that it is done to the best of your abilities.
